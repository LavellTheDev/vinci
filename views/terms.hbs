	<p> <span style="font-weight: 800">VINCI Intellectual Property</span> Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or the content you access made by Vinci. You may not use, reuse, or distribute content from our Services or generated by Vinci unless you obtain permission from a Vinci Representative or are otherwise permitted by law. Do not remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our Services.</p>

	<p>Our Services display some content that is not Vinci’s. This content is the sole responsibility of the entity that makes it available. We may review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. But that does not necessarily mean that we review content, so please don’t assume that we do.</p>

	<p><span style="font-weight: 800">Storage</span> When the Services provide storage, we recommend that you continue to back up your content regularly. We may create reasonable technical limits on your content, such as limits on file size, storage space, processing capacity, and other technical limits. We may suspend the Services until you are within the storage space limit associated with your account.</p>

	<p>In connection with your use of the Services, we may send you service announcements, administrative messages, and other information. You may opt out of some of those communications.</p>

	<p>Some of our Services are available on mobile devices. Do not use such Services in a way that distracts you and prevents you from obeying traffic or safety laws.</p>

	<h3>2. Your VINCI Account</h3>

	<p>You may need a VINCI account in order to use our Services. You may create your own VINCI account, or your VINCI account may be assigned to you 	by an administrator, such as your employer. 
	If you are using a VINCI Account assigned to you by an administrator, different or additional terms may apply and your administrator may be able to access or disable your account.
	</p>

	<p>To protect your VINCI Account, keep your password confidential. You are responsible for the activity that happens on or through your VINCI Account. Try not to reuse your VINCI Account password on third-party applications. If you learn of any unauthorized use of your password or VINCI Account, follow these instructions <a href="/help">here</a>.</p>

	<h3>3. Privacy and Copyright Protection</h3>
	<p>VINCI’s privacy policies explain how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you use our Services. By using our Services, you agree that VINCI can use such data in accordance with our privacy policies.</p>

	<p>We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminate accounts of repeat infringers according to the process set out in the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act.</p>

	<p>We provide information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual property online. If you think somebody is violating your copyrights and want to notify us, you can find information about submitting notices and VINCI’s policy about responding to notices on our Support Page.</p>

	<h3>4. Your Content in our Services</h3>

	<p><span style="font-weight: 800">Ownership.</span> Some of our Services allow you to upload, submit, store, send or receive content. You retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in that content. We do not claim any ownership rights to your content. In short, what belongs to you stays yours.</p>

	<p>When you upload, submit, store, send or receive content to or through our Services, you give VINCI (and those we work with) a worldwide license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works (such as those resulting from translations, adaptations or other changes we make so that your content works better with our Services), communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such content. The rights you grant in this license are for the limited purpose of operating, promoting, and improving our Services, and to develop new ones. This license continues even if you stop using our Services. Some Services may offer you ways to access and remove content that has been provided to that Service. Also, in some of our Services, there are terms or settings that narrow the scope of our use of the content submitted in those Services. Make sure you have the necessary rights to grant us this license for any content that you submit to our Services.</p>

	<h3>5. About Software in our Services</h3>

	<p><span style="font-weight: 800">Updates.</span> When a Service requires or includes downloadable software, this software may update automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available via Steam or Unity. Some Services may let you adjust your automatic update settings.</p>

	<p><span style="font-weight: 800">Software Use.</span> You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our Services or included software, nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit those restrictions or you have our written permission.</p>

	<p><span style="font-weight: 800">Open Source Software.</span> Open source software is important to us. Some software used in our Services may be offered under an open source license that we will make available to you. There may be provisions in the open source license that expressly override some of these terms.</p>

	<h3>6. Modifying and Terminating Our Services</h3>

	<p>We are constantly changing and improving our Services. We may add or remove functionalities or features, and we may suspend or stop a Service altogether. </p>

	<p>You can stop using our services at anytime. VINCI may also stop providing Services to you, or add or create new limits to our Services at any time.</p>

	<h3>7. Our Warranties and Disclaimers</h3>

	<p>We provide our Services using a commercially reasonable level of skill and care, but there are certain things we don’t promise about our services.</p>

	<p>OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET OUT IN THESE TERMS OR ADDITIONAL TERMS, NEITHER VINCI NOR ITS SUPPLIERS/DISTRIBUTORS OF ANY KIND MAKE ANY SPECIFIC PROMISES ABOUT THE SERVICE.</p>

	<p>WE DON’T MAKE ANY COMMITMENTS ABOUT THE CONTENT WITHIN THE SERVICES , THE SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS OF THE SERVICES, OR THEIR RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, OR ABILITY TO MEET YOUR NEEDS. WE PROVIDE SERVICES “AS-IS”.</p>

	<p>TO THE EXTENT OF THE PERMITTED LAW, WE EXCLUDE ALL WARRANTIES. </p>

	<h3>8. Liabilities for our Services</h3>

	<p>WHEN PERMITTED BY LAW, VINCI AND VINCI SUPPLIERS/DISTRIBUTORS OF ANY KIND, WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOST PROFIT, REVENUES, OR DATA , FINANCIAL LOSSES - WHETHER DIRECT OR INDIRECT - SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES. </p>

	<p>TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF VINCI AND ITS SUPPLIERS/DISTRIBUTORS OF ANY KIND, FOR ANY CLAIMS UNDER THESE TERMS, INCLUDING FOR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAY US TO USE THE SERVICES (OR, IF VINCI CHOOSES, THE COST TO SUPPLY YOU THE SERVICES AGAIN).</p>

	<p>IN ALL CASES, VINCI, AND ITS SUPPLIERS/DISTRIBUTORS OF ANY KIND, WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE THAT IS NOT REASONABLY FORESEEABLE.</p>

	<h3>9. Business uses of our Service</h3>

	<p>If you are using VINCI’s Services on behalf of a business, that business accepts these terms. It will hold harmless and indemnify VINCI and its affiliates, officers, agents, and employees from any claim, suit or action arising from or related to the use of these Services or violations of these terms, including any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, suits, judgements, litigation costs and attorney's’ fees. </p>

	<h3>10. About these Terms</h3>

	<p>VINCI may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services. You should look at the terms regularly. We’ll post notice of modifications to these terms on this page. We’ll post notice of modified additional terms in the applicable Service. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than fourteen days after they are posted. However, changes addressing new functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should discontinue your use of that Service.</p>

	<p>If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the additional terms will control for that conflict.</p>

	<p>These terms control the relationship between VINCI and you. They do not create any third party beneficiary rights.</p>

	<p>If you do not comply with these terms, and we don’t take action right away, this doesn’t mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future).</p>

	<p>If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.</p>

	<p>The laws of Delaware, U.S.A., excluding Delaware’s conflict of laws rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services. All claims arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of New Castle County, Delaware, USA, and you and VINCI consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.</p>
